# Functional DDD Template

This is a functional Domain-Driven Design (DDD) template that provides a structured foundation for building applications using the functional programming paradigm. The template follows the principles of DDD and includes the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern to separate write and read operations.

## Features

#### Layered Architecture: 
The template promotes a layered architecture approach, consisting of the API layer, application layer, domain layer, and infrastructure layer. This separation of concerns allows for modular and testable code.

#### Domain-Driven Design: 
The template emphasizes the importance of capturing the business domain by implementing domain models and applying business rules within the domain layer. It promotes the use of a Ubiquitous Language and aggregates to model complex business concepts.

#### CQRS Pattern: 
The template leverages the CQRS pattern to separate write (command) operations from read (query) operations. This promotes scalability, performance optimization, and a clear separation of concerns between the different types of operations.

#### Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL): 
The template provides support for an Anti-Corruption Layer, which acts as a bridge between the domain layer and external systems. The ACL helps to maintain the integrity and consistency of the domain model when interacting with external dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, All you need to do is Clone or download the repository to your local development environment, rename it and use it. This template comes with all layers already implemented along with the Unit Tests in place.

## Lets talk a little bit more about the layers implemented in the Template:

### **Domain Layer**: 
The domain layer represents the core of the system. It consists of business models identified in the Ubiquitous Language of the domain. The domain layer uses aggregates, which are cohesive units of business logic and data. Aggregates enforce consistency boundaries and encapsulate the domain's behavior and rules. The domain layer focuses on capturing the essential concepts of the business and expressing them in a domain-specific language.

### **Application Layer**: 
The application layer, part of the domain, implements the business logic and uses abstractions to communicate with external systems. It follows the CQRS pattern, separating write operations (commands) from read operations (queries). The application layer processes commands, applying business rules and modifying the domain state. It also dispatches queries to retrieve data from read models. The application layer talks to external systems through abstractions, ensuring a decoupled and testable design.

### **Infrastructure Layer**: 
The infrastructure layer provides the technical foundation for the system. It is the Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL), which shields the domain layer from the complexities of external systems. The ACL translates and adapts external interfaces and data formats to match the domain's language and concepts. The infrastructure layer also encompasses components such as databases, external services, and other infrastructure-related code required for the system's operation. Infrastructure layer implements the abstractions defined in the application layer.

### **API Layer**: 
The API layer acts as the contract between the external world and the domain. It defines the communication endpoints and handles the serialization and deserialization of data. The API layer provides a standardized way for clients to send commands and queries to the system, adhering to the domain's language and concepts.

In summary, the API layer acts as the contract between the domain and the external world, the application layer implements the business logic using abstractions and follows the CQRS pattern, the domain layer represents the core business models and applies business rules, and the infrastructure layer is the ACL that translates the domain abstractions to external systems. This layered architecture with the CQRS pattern and the ACL helps separate concerns, maintain a clean design, and enable functional Domain-Driven Design practices.
